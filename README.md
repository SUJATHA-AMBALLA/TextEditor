# TextEditor

_Overview_ : 
This project is a Text Editor built from scratch using Java with Swing and AWT libraries. It provides basic text editing functionalities such as cut, copy, paste, save, and open. Additionally, the editor implements stack-based undo and redo functionality for better text manipulation.

_Features_ : 
New Document: Create a new text document.
Open: Open an existing text file.
Save: Save the current text to a file.
Cut: Cut selected text to clipboard.
Copy: Copy selected text to clipboard.
Paste: Paste text from clipboard at the cursor position.
Undo/Redo: Text manipulation using stacks (via the Stack<Character> class).
Caret Listener: Tracks the caret position and ensures text is properly handled during editing.

_Technologies Used_ : 
Java: For implementing the core logic.
Swing/AWT: For building the GUI components like buttons, text areas, and file chooser dialogs.
File I/O: For opening and saving files using the Java File I/O API.

_Requirements_  : 
Java 8 or higher.
